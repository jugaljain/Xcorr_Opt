 1. Define the ReRollA & ReRollB functions in unroll_op_gradient.cu.cc
 2. Modify compile.sh to add compilations unroll_op_gradient.cc and unroll_op_gradient.cu.cc into the compiled normxcorr.so file
 3. Register the gradient of unroll_op to be unroll_op_gradient.
 4. Test the gradient implementation This might help: https://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2017/04/21/how-to-test-gradient-implementations/ 
 5. Re-integrate the final custom-op into Manideep's person re-id project, further test for improvements in loss and accuracy.
 		a. Try different datasets, compare results.
